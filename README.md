# InvisiblityCloak
This program lets you to select a color by taping on it and it invisible.
click on the color you you want to make invisible.(make sure only that thing is of that color)
you can select multiple colors based on your requirement and press 'c' to clear previous one selection.
And you can use arrow keys to adjust the threshold of the colors to make it invisible.

In this every pixel is compared to the selected colors and if the pixel is in the threshold distance from the selected color it will be made invisible. and this generates 2 colors with a lot less colors and comapare them to better the cloth detection.

this program is not the best at what it does.(i will change it later).
